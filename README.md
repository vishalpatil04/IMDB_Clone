IMDB Front end design using react.
This project is created to practice on react js hooks and route.
While completing this front end project I got to lean about react hooks like useState and useEffect.
I also learned about React Routes, how to install routes and use in project as well got to learn aboout updation in routes in ES6.
As well as i learned how to fetch data from API's endpoints and display this data on our page.
It takes me 3-4 hous to complete this project.
